	/// Section Table (Section Headers)
	/// 
	/// Each row of the section table is, in effect, a section header. 
	/// This table immediately follows the optional header, if any. 
	/// This positioning is required because the file header does not contain a direct pointer to the section table. 
	/// Instead, the location of the section table is determined by calculating the location of the first byte after the headers. 
	/// Make sure to use the size of the optional header as specified in the file header.
	/// 
	/// The number of entries in the section table is given by the NumberOfSections field in the file header. 
	/// Entries in the section table are numbered starting from one (1). 
	/// The code and data memory section entries are in the order chosen by the linker.
	/// 
	/// In an image file, the VAs for sections must be assigned by the linker so that they are in ascending order and adjacent, 
	/// and they must be a multiple of the SectionAlignment value in the optional header.
	/// 
	/// Each section header (section table entry) has the following format, for a total of 40 bytes per entry.
